hashcode()
If two objects are the same as per the equals(Object) method, then if we call the hashCode() method on each of the two objects, it must provide the same integer result.

Equals()
reflexive: An object x must be equal to itself, which means, for object x, equals(x) should return true.
symmetric: for two given objects x and y, x.equals(y) must return true if and only if equals(x) returns true.
transitive: for any objects x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) should 
return true.
consistent: for any objects x and y, the value of x.equals(y) should change, only if the property in equals() changes.
