A 1- Java is not a pure object oriented language beacause it supports primitive data types but it has way to convert it in to object.

A 2-Pointers are name of memory location in c and c++.java not suppotrs pointers beacause of complexity.

A 4-By while loop and do while infinite loop is declared in java,if we use break statement infinite loop is not exist.
   Example                  int i=10
               While( i>=1){
                System.out.println("i:"+i);
                }
              output
               i=10,10,10,10..................................................................


A 5-Yes we can overload main method beacause we Jvm will look only aruguments in main method.

A 6-Beacause we acceses by with out creating a object.

A 7-*The method which declared with static keyword  is called Static method.
    *The variable which declared with static keyword is called static variable.
    * The classes which declared with static keyword is called static classes.

A 9-Memory allocations are Method area Heap area,stack area,Pc resigter,natvie method area.
                                      
A 10-               Instance variable                       Local Variable
   * Variable which is decalred inside class but    * Variable which is decalred outside  method,block,constrtucor.
     out side method,block,constrtucor.
   * Thses are store in Heap memory.                * Thses are store in stack memory. 
   *Initialztion is must for I V                    * Initialztion is not must and should.   
   * I V are created at time of object creation     * L V are created at time of block execution
     and destroy wheh  object destory                 and destroy when block execution is complete.
     
A 11-We need to creat an object.

A 12-JDK is Java development kit it provide enviorment to develop an application.
     Variants of JDK are a.Javac
                         b.java
                         c.javap
                         d.javadoc
                         e.javah
                         f.javad

A 13-JDK-Java development kit provied enviorment to develop a program.
     JRE- JRE is part of JDK,Java run time enviorment provied enviorment to run a program.
     JVM-JVM is part of JRE ,java virtual machine execute and interpert the code line by line.

A 14-this and super keyword can use together.

A 16-polymorphsim is an avialbilty of an object to take more than one form.
     and ploymorphism is achieve by two ways 1.Compile time ploymorphism (method overloading)2.Run time ploymorshism(method overriding).
      example-man can take many more at same time.
       
        program on Compile Time ploymorpsim
           Public class addition{
             Static int add(int a,int b){
               return a+b;
               }
           static int add(int a,int b,int c){
             return a+b+c;
             }
             } 
         public class additionDemo{
         public static void main(String args[]){
          System.out.println(addition.add(10,20);
          System.out.println(addition.add(30,40,50);
            }
            }
      output 30
            120

A 17- Abstarction is hinding an implemention details and showing only features to user is called Abstarction.
      example-Send a sms ,driving a car.
    
      Abstarct class University{
       abstarct void Syallbus();
       void result(){
       System.out.println(" University is decalred result");
       }
       Abstarct College extends University{
         void Syallbus(){
          System.out.println("University will give syallbus for different branches");
        }
       public class UniversityCollegeDemo{
        public static void main(String args[]){
         College  college=new College();
         college.Syallbus();
         college.result();
       }
       }
    output
       University will give syallbus for different branches.
       University is decalred result.

 A 19 -     Abstarct class                                                                    Interface
     *The class which decalre with abstarct keyword is abstarct class.    *The class which decalre with Interface keyword is interface.
     * Abstarct class have abstarct method and non abstarct method.       *Interface have abstarct method.
     * Abstarct class will inherit using extends keyword.                 *Interface will inherit using implement keyword.
     * Multiple inheritance is not achieve by abstarct class.             *Multiple inheritance is achieve by Interface.

A-20 *Method overloading in java we can creat same method name in class but they have to be different in paremeter and method can performed based on parametrs.
     * In java method reslovation is done by complier based on refernce type.
     * It is used to achieve complie time ploymorphism.
       example -int add(int a,int b)
                int add(int a,int b,int c)

A -21 *Method overriding in java is changing the implemention of parent class by child class.
      *By default whatever parents as method are availabe to child class but if child class not statisfied with parents implements then  child will change the implements.
      *Method overriding method resolvation done by Jvm based on run time object.
      * It is used to achieve Run time ploymorphism.
                  public class SBI{
                  void rateOfInterset(){
                   System.out.println("SBI rate of interset is 5%);
                   }
                   }
                   public class Vijay Bank extends SBI{
                    void rateOfInterset(){
                    System.out.println("Vijay Bank rate of interset is 8%);
                   }
                   }
                    public class Method overridingDemo{
                   public static void main(String args[]){
                    VijayBank vijayBakn=new VijayBank();
                    vijayBank.rateOfInterset();
                     }
                     }
                    outout -Vijay Bank rate of interset is 8%
                       

  A -22       No


 A-23 * Method name and paremeter must be same.
      * Is A realationship.
      * Return type must be same until java 1.5 and after 1.8 retrun type will be co-variant return type of parent class.
      *Parent calss should  not  final 
      *Parent calss can be abstrct and non abstarct.

A-24 *Compostion is strong realtionship.
     * without existing contianer object there will no chance of contained object hence conatiner and contianed object have strong relation.
     Example- Human and heart.
              Bike and engine.

A-26    public class Squareroot{
         public static void main(String args[]){
            System.out.println(math.squtr(25));
          }
          }

A -27  Constructor is block of code it is used creat object and initialized an objcet with respect to current object.
       Yes we can overload Constructor.

A -28 Default Constructor and Parmeterzied Constructor.
       Default Constructor-
    *  Default Constructor is Constructor which does not have any  parameter is default Contructor
    * Jvm will provide default values based on data types.
      Example -Gun();
       Parameterzied Constructor
    * Constructor which  have  parameter is parameterzied Constructor.
     Example -Gun(name,color);
 
A 29- *Single Inheritance -Subclass will access the properties of superclass by using extends keyword.
         Syntax     subclass extends superclass
         Example  aniaml extends dog
      * Multilevel Inheritance -Subclass will access the properties of superclass by using extends keyword and same subclass act super class for onther subclass.
        Syntax     subclass1 extends superclass 1
                   superclass(Subclass1)extends subclass
         Example  animal extends Dog
                  Dog extends BabyDog
     * Hierarchiacal Inheritance-Two subclass will access the the properties of one super class using extends keyword
          Syntax   Subclass extends superclass
                   Subclass extends superclass
         Example -Animal extends Dog
                 Animal extends Cat
    *  Multiple Inheritance-Subcalss will access the properties two super class using extends keyword and java does not support multiple inheritance by class
         but support by using interface.
         Syntax   subclass extends superclass,superclass
        Example -Animal extends Dog,Cat
   * Hybrid Inheritance-Is  combination of multilevel and Hierarchical Inheritance.
